This repository contains the source code of a hybrid framework for sentiment analysis that addresses the challenges of noisy, imbalanced, and short-text data.
The approach combines data augmentation, transformer-based embeddings, gradient-boosted decision trees, and ensemble averaging to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both binary and ternary sentiment classification tasks.
